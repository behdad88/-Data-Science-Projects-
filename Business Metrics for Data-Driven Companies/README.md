### What are business metrics?
What is the highest and best use of a business analyst or a business data analyst?
The answer is:
- To find out the right question to ask. Then, find the best answer you possibly can in the time, and with the resources available. 
- Ensuring that your answer has practical impact by translating it into a specific call to action. A specific recommended action, communicated to the relevant decision makers. Using visual metaphors and non technical language.

**What is always the right question?**
What change, in our business processes can and should we make right now? To `increase revenues`, `maximize profitability` or `reduce our risk`.

**What do we mean by, right now?**
There are several answers. 
- The ideal answer is something like, our company has engineered real time, computerized systems. That optimize for certain dynamic metrics. By adjusting our response to customer and market input. With a delay for processing or latency, of no more than a fraction of a second. 
- The next best answer is what we call Just in Time. A computerized response is not possible. So we respond to individual customers with a human being. Where that human being has access to the full historical record, of that customers interactions with the company. Whether through buying things, customer support calls, actions on our website, etc. 
- The third best answer, which is still good, is that the change that we are recommending, can't happen overnight. But it can happen as soon as it has been empirically tested and shown to work. We do testing by making one small change at a time to our website. Creating two different versions, A and B, and comparing which performs better. This is called AB testing. In any case, an AB test can begin within 30 days of a recommendation. And the recommended change can be made as soon as enough data is gathered. To determine that one choice is clearly better than the other. 

So metrics are special numbers that help us to ask and answer the right business question. What decision should we make? What process should we change right now? Metrics are numbers that we can impact when we change our business processes.  For example, for a local bricks and mortar retail clothing store rooted in the state of North Carolina. Where we have a 4.75% sales tax, the sales tax is not a metric. There's nothing that we can do to change it. It's basically a fact of nature for us like the weather. On the other hand the percentage of people who viewed our ad on a particular website. Then used it as a link to click through to our homepage. Can change every time the ad contents and appearance change. Or when the time of day changes, where we run the ad, on what websites it appears and etc.

### Distinguishing Revenue, Profitability and Risk Metrics
All business metrics can be classified into three broad categories. 
1. Revenue metrics
2. Profitability metrics
3. Risk metrics

One way to help distinguish for a particular metric, which of these three categories it falls into, is to think about what people in the company depend on this information and will ask for it. 
Revenue metrics relate to `sales` and `marketing`. Profitability metrics to `efficiency` and
`logistics`, `production`, and `operations`. And risk metrics to `risk management`, and are widely used by a company's creditors,
and outside investors. 

#### Revenue metrics

Revenue metrics are outward facing. They tell us something about how well or badly the company is marketing and selling its products. The company sales force, typically led by a vice resident of sales, will want to know how many units of each product were sold over a given time interval and how this compares to the same time interval last year and the year before. They will want to look at sales by region, by product and by new versus repeat customers. And they will want to know about the sales funnel, the potential future customers who have been identified, and where they are in the step by step process of moving towards making a purchase. Meanwhile, the marketing team, typically led by a VP of marketing, will want to know how effective any marketing campaigns may be. How many people have seen a particular advertisement or email marketing piece or mail offer? What percentage have responded, etc? Everything that relates directly or indirectly to selling is a revenue metric. 

#### Profitability metrics

Profitability metrics have to do with the efficiency of the processes by which the company creates and delivers its products and services to customers. These are operational metrics, sought after by those people in the company responsible for production. Typically led in a large company
by the chief operating officer. Anything that relates to how much cash is tied up in the form of unsold inventory, how much production is unsaleable
due to spoilage or wastage. Or at the other extreme, how often the company is unable to meet urgent customer requests and loses sales because of insufficient production or inventory. What portion of products off a production
line are rejected as defective, how much is spent on variable costs, raw materials and labor, per unit product and etc. These are all efficiency metrics. Note that even a company with large and rapidly increasing revenues will fail to be profitable if it cannot deliver its offerings efficiently. Large established companies with relatively little room to increase revenues can often achieve significant increases in profitability by focusing on improving operational efficiencies. 

#### Risk metrics

Risk metrics have to do with tracking and where possible reducing the many potential dangers a company faces. For example, if a company is spending a large portion of its net cash flow every month on interest on its debts, then even a small drop in revenues caused by some external shock, like a recession, could cause the company to become insolvent and collapse. Secured creditors have the right to seize a company's assets if they're not paid on time and that would close down the business. Net cash out is always the most important metric to track. How many months can the company survive at the present burn rate? Another example of risk metric is churn, a company with a subscription based revenue model that has a very high churn rate, the rate at which new subscribers drop off within a year, runs the risk that over time, there are fewer targets who have never been customers and it becomes impossible to maintain revenue growth or even hold steady. The greater the reliance on long term recurring revenue customers, the less dependent a company is on constantly successfully converting new prospects into clients and that's a lot less risky. Other examples of risk metrics
are specific to the financial industry. Banks that issue credit cards are in the business of tracking how much exposure they have to potential customer defaults at any time and what percentage of their customers are expected to default in the next six months or are in default now. Money managers use volatility of returns and something called the maximum historical drawn down from high water mark, which we'll explain later, as a proxy for their portfolio's risk exposure. I've noticed in general that most risk metrics are related in one way or another to leverage. Anyone whose survival depends on their ability to pay back a large amount of borrowed money faces a magnified risk from any misfortune. 

> Revenue metrics are for optimistic extroverts, profitability metrics for fastidious perfectionists, and risk metrics for informed skeptics. A great company will harness all three types of temperaments and track all three types of metrics.

### Distinguishing Traditional and Dynamic Metrics

`Traditional business metrics` include standard financial and managerial accounting categories, such as quarterly statements of net cash flow, profits and losses, and changes to balance sheet items such as shareholder's equity. Traditional business metrics have their origins primarily in paper and pencil after the fact reporting. Business decisions, that might be made based on these metrics, will happen usually after long deliberation, sometimes on a scale of months to years. 
`Dynamic Business Metrics` are defined and can be communicated in a manner that conveys urgency. Metrics that address the right question, what change in our business processes can we make right now to increase revenues, maximize profitability, or reduce risk? 
Two attributes make a business metric dynamic.
- First, will the metric change significantly over intervals of a month or less? If not, it's not very dynamic. For example, the monthly rent a stand alone retail store in a mall pays on its three-year real estate lease is of course a business metric related to its efficiency and profitability, but it is not a dynamic business metric. There's no point in tracking it because it won't change anytime soon. On the other hand, if a national retail chain with 1,000 mall-based stores is individually negotiating and signing an average of about seven new three-year leases each week, it can and should track average monthly rent per square foot on new real estate leases as an important dynamic metric, against which to set goals and track progress.
- Second, are their specific actions the company can take that can visibly or significantly impact the metric in the short term? If not, then the metric doesn't lend itself to dynamic tracking. Whether the metric is dynamic, may also depend on the business context. For example, if the 1,000 store retail chain we just mentioned is neither adding nor closing stores and is simply renewing leases on current space, where the old leases had pre-negotiated  terms to be extended, It will be difficult to make much impact on the average monthly rent per square foot. On the other hand, if that retail chain publicly announces that it is going to close 25% of its US retail stores, as the GAP chain did in June of 2015, it may be able to go back to landlords with the proposition, either we leave at the end of the current lease and you'll need to find a new tenant, if you can, who may not pay as much per square foot as we do. Or let's renegotiate our lease terms now. In this case, the average monthly rent per square foot for newly renegotiated leases would be a dynamic metric for the GAP. It's a place they could save money. This is why announcing all your bad newsat once is often a good business strategy. How much impact a business change can have on the metric, is another important thing that we need to observe. If the metric is noisy, then lots of things are affecting it. If its twitchy, that means it's very specifically offended by what we're doing. Traditional metrics, like quarterly revenues, are impacted by dozen of different factors, many of which are completely outside the control of our business. The great new advertising campaign that we launched may not even show up in quarterly revenue metrics if, in fact, most of our customers are government agencies on long-term contracts with a very long sales cycle. Total revenues is always an aggregate number, and as they say on the Kissmetrics website, aggregate data is kind of worthless. Dynamic metrics are twitchy. Small changes in process, in our process, can lead to big impact. For example the percentage of people who will fill an online shopping cart and take their shopping cart all the way to purchase is extremely sensitive to average page load times. Studies have shown that pages that load in three or more seconds are much less likely to lead to sales than pages that load in less than three seconds. 40% of web users will abandon completely, a web page that does not load in three seconds. This is why there's an entire industry devoted to what's called edge caching. Content delivery networks, like Akamai, that retail stores pay to store copies of their websites locally, physically near their customers around the world, saving a precious second or two in load times.
