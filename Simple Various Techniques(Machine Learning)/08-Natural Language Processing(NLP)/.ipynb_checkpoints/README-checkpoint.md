## Natural Language Processing(NLP)

Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human(natural) language.
In a simple sense, Natural language Processing is applying machine learning to text and language to teach computers understanding what is said in the spoken and written words. The main focus of NLP is to read, decipher, understand and make sense of the human language in a manner that is useful. 


**Examples of NLP in Real Life**

You will find a lot of applications of NLP in your life. Here we name a few

- Translating one language to another i.e. Google Translator
- Checking grammatical errors i.e. Microsoft word or Grammarly applies NLP to check and correct grammatical errors.
- Sentiment analysis that is identifying the mood or subjective opinions of a text
- Summarizing a text or article
- Predicting the genre of books
- Speech recognition which is used in the virtual assistants such as Apple Siri, Google Assistant, and Amazon Alexa 
- Question answering

**How NLP Works?**

Most of NLP algorithms are classification models, and they include Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes,  CART which is a model based on decision trees, Maximum Entropy and other classification algorithms to predict the outcome.



A very well-known model in NLP is the Bag of Words model. It is a model used to preprocess the texts to classify before fitting the classification algorithms on the observations containing the texts.

This Repo, consist of :

- Clean texts to prepare them for the Machine Learning models,
- Create a Bag of Words model,
- Apply Machine Learning models onto this Bag of Worlds model.
