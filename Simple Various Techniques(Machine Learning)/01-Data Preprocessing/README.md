## part one the pre-processing.
I had to start with this part because this is a crucial step in the journey of making a machine learning model.
If there is no data pre-processing your machine learning model won't work properly.
Imagine you are about to go for a long journey while you have to prepare.It's in every book your flights book your hotels and pack your luggage.
Although, that's definitely the boring part for the trip.But then when everything is well-prepared and you're ready to go your trip might be amazing.

It's the same for our machine learning journey.We have to prepare some stuff in order to make sure that we build our machine learning models without any issues and this stuff that we need to prepare for machine learning trip happens to be data pre-processing.

Trust me we have to do it because if we don't do it we will miss out on all the fun of machine learning.
So, I did the best I could to gather in this part all the essentials of data pre-processing and even if I made sure to make it as simple as possible there is all you need to know about data pre-processing.
